            "comment": "I am commenting not only as a Cleveland resident but as someone who feels wounded by what has happened to WCSB. When I first moved here, WCSB made me feel at home in Cleveland. For decades, that station was more than noise in the air — it was a living, breathing pulse in our city. Students, artists, activists, and fans of the underground, as well as curious souls, all found a home there. You did not just take over a radio signal — you extinguished a voice. \n Learning that Cleveland State abruptly handed over WCSB’s programming to Ideastream’s JazzNEO, with solely smooth jazz 24/7, felt like betrayal — especially to the students who poured so much of their hearts into that place. \n It was said that this “move will bring more opportunity to the students.” But look at what they’ve done: \n -They silenced their creative freedom. \n -They stripped away the diversity of voices and genres that defined WCSB. \n -They replaced a dynamic, community-rooted learning ground with something bland and sterile. \n -They delivered this change with no notice, no real consultation, and no apparent respect. \n This is not transformation. This is confiscation. Do you know what they’ve taken from Cleveland? They’ve taken a platform for voices nobody else would hear. They’ve taken a space where students could experiment, fail, learn, push boundaries, and connect with the city. They’ve taken a bridge between campus and community. They’ve taken history. \n I understand that universities must evolve, and that financial concerns and strategic shifts are real. But they do not have to throw the baby out with the bathwater. They do not have to silence thousands to “modernize.” They can preserve the station’s soul and explore new paths. \n \n Here’s what I hope will happen: \n They’ll reverse the takeover, or at least restore a portion of the student-run freeform programming. \n Establish real, binding guarantees — in writing — that the students will retain control over content and scheduling. \n Reopen channels of dialogue: host public forums, involve students, alumni, and community members in deciding the station’s future. \n Commit to transparency about how this decision was made, who benefited, and how “opportunity” will be real and meaningful (not just lip service). \n If they want to talk about “shared governance,” “equity,” or “community engagement,” start by restoring WCSB. Let the people they claim to serve have a voice again. I and many others in Cleveland will be watching and waiting. I hope they do the right thing. Return our radio station. Don’t let this legacy be erased by bureaucratic indifference. \n Sincerely, \n Erika Karl \n Cleveland resident",

            "comment": "I am absolutely appalled at the way that CSU and Ideastream Public Media colluded to take over the student and community-run radio station WCSB. WCSB is a well-loved, valuable resource to many of our local communities, and we will fight fiercely to have it restored to the people who love it— both the volunteers who run it as well as those of us who are loyal listeners. WCSB has been serving our communities for almost 50 years, and most of their budget comes from listener donations. The station has been a part of so many of our lives over the decades, providing a breathtakingly diverse lineup of music, entertainment, and public affairs programming, and providing opportunities for students and community members to gain valuable and wide-ranging experience, as well as the ability to express themselves creatively, have their voices heard, and find their place in the world. \n \n Turning the airwaves of WCSB over to Ideastream to be run as a pre-programmed jazz station is a terrible idea. I can’t imagine that those involved really thought it through before going ahead with this deal, or that they knew what they were doing. I understand that Ideastream seems to just want to take over as many FM radio stations as it can get its hands on, without regard to the impact on the local community. But this is not serving the public interest. And what is the long-term goal, here? WCSB as a student and community-run station has built up an incredibly loyal listening base over these 50 years. Have Ideastream and CSU thought about how long the Jazz-Neo station will run? How much of the community will be served? Will this station still be running in 50 years? Or even 20 years? While there may be a segment of the public who will listen to a pre-programmed jazz station, I can guarantee that no one will love this new station, no one will be passionate about it, and it will never have the life-changing impact on anyone that the real WCSB has had on so many people over the years. \n \n I support the Cleveland City Council Resolution to urge CSU and Ideastream to return radio station WCSB to the students and communities that have built and run it for the past 50 years, to support the station so that it can continue in its mission of serving our diverse communities, and I would like to see a pledge in place that CSU will never again make a decision for the station that leaves the station members out of the process. I look forward to the next 50 years of our beloved WCSB!",

It runs deep in my family. For me, this love is so much more than just appreciating artistic sounds. There's a whole new dimension that comes with being embedded in a culture that creates and explores and appreciates music together. Wcsb used to provide a hub for that culture in Cleveland. I got to know many of the DJs personally, attending the shows they promoted, and even having the chance to express myself on stage and on air. We supported each others artistic endeavors personally, and the station did such an enormous amount to facilitate that cultural exchange. Ideastream is cool, but it cannot and will not ever be able to replace what student run radio at CSU did for culture in Cleveland. Thank you for your time",

On behalf of myself, my band, and our followers, I'd like to say I'm appalled at CSU's decision to rip the control of WCSB away from the students. It's clear that CSU, and Laura Bloomberg see the community, and the student body as an opportunity for profit. The removal of WCSB from students deprives the Cleveland area of an outlet of music, culture, speech, and community. I urge council members to support the WCSB resolution to have it returned to the students.",

I was only able to do 7 shows before we were cut off and was looking forward to doing my show for the next 4 years. The only welcoming thing about CSU was the community and friends I gained from joining WCSB. Not only did I make friends, but I planned on using WCSB as a jumping off point for my career. I’m deeply saddened and frustrated by this decision because students like myself were clearly not taken into consideration. I strongly think that returning WCSB to it’s community is the best decision for CSU and Cleveland as a whole.",

As I dug deeper into WRUW, I quickly grew to understand WCSB, and not to count out WJCU, as the friendliest rivals I’ve known in my life.  Tuning in to these stations and bouncing around became a part of my daily routine, one that continued until earlier this month.  The sheer amount of thrilling music I would likely have never heard otherwise were it not for WCSB was, frankly, among life’s reliant joys, and I’m proud to consider many of the programmers behind the airplay to be among the most brilliant, creative friends and peers I’ve known.  And in my travels throughout the U.S. and abroad, Cleveland’s now-once-flourishing and historic college radio scene was one of my foremost points of pride when discussing my adopted hometown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeyond the personal anecdotes, as members of council have made mention, WCSB was a vital resource of local and regional community engagement, far beyond the campus of Cleveland State and provided a voice for countless ethnic groups in Cleveland for decades.  The sheer history evades my comprehension, as a good amount of it happened before I was born.  For all of it to evaporate overnight, for students to be perp walked out by campus police, for nobody on the ground to have notice or deliberation in the process, is insulting, sickening, disturbing, and dangerous.  As the leery details of the ordeal continue to emerge, more salt gets dumped callously in the open, untreated wounds of those who volunteered themselves to freeform radio.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am grateful to see members of council willing to speak out and take action on this matter.  I demand full transparency from Cleveland State University and Ideastream, the immediate return of the 89.3-FM frequency to WCSB, and the reopening of its station to its staff and students.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs free speech is actively under fire on the national level, and as we continue to see endless institutions cow-tow in the name of shady financial interests, the sudden silencing of one of Cleveland’s - and the U.S. in general’s - truest outlets for free thought sets a dangerous precedent in dangerous times.  I can at least write with confidence that history will continue to find favor in free speech, American college radio, and WCSB.",

CSU stripping WCSB of its programming not only silences the voices of the radio show hosts, but the voices of any artists that were played on those shows.

Students having the airwaves means a great deal to many Clevelanders, and we see how seriously the students and independent hosts took on that responsibility. Independent and student-run media will always be more important and impactful than corporate media - where the purpose is to appease as many people as possible or risk hurting the bottom line.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, the community needs transparency on what’s happening.",

I can't put a price on any of the music that I've gotten from the show, or the entertainment I've gotten from the programs and I'm not going to echo all the other comments about the communities or the shady way the station was taken down; those are givens. Bring back the only damn radio station that was live in Cleveland late at night so people who work third shift can feel like they don't live in a ghost town. It was one of the few stations that also broadcast local events and concerts connecting the city. Which, if Cleveland's goal is to become a 15 minute worldly city, this is a step in the opposite direction. It's a detriment to Cleveland in so many ways to lose WCSB and to have it replaced by Ideastream smooth jazz, with hardly any local programming it's just insult to injury. In an era where we're growing further and further apart from differing politics and other nonsense, WCSB was a welcome change in the sea of non corporate radio and a bastion of unique voices and welcome distraction with things you wouldn't hear anywhere else. No political ads, no same 20 songs over and over, no messaging you'd hear from the other stations. Beyond that, it sucks getting old and sucks not knowing what's going on since I don't really use social media and without WCSB I have one less avenue left to me for knowing what's going on locally with concerts and events. Please give us back our station.",

The deal that took place between Ideastream and Cleveland State University denies service to these communities in exchange for serving one group of people - mainstream jazz fans who don&#039;t have HD Radio.  This is an unacceptable deal for the thousands of Clevelanders who tuned in to hear diverse voices and a plethora of music genres.  This is an unacceptable deal for the Clevelanders who keep up with their friends and family over the four line phone system that stayed busy during every late night talk show.  And this is an unacceptable deal for the students of Cleveland State University who are losing out on true ownership of an artistic endeavor and learning the skills needed to pull off future projects.  My hope is that this deal made for the purposes of Ideastream board membership for someone who is not even from Cleveland will be made null and void.",

But suffice it to say that we had one of the rarest cultural assets in the world frankly, and that is not a statement I make lightly. This arrangement for Ideastream to take over the airwaves of WCSB in such a secretive and hostile way by two individuals who are neither from Cleveland, nor have either of them even listened the the station that they have deemed unworthy of existence, cannot be tolerated. CSU is publicly funded institution, and as such should be beholden to the public and not a board of people so out of touch that they would allow this to happen.

As an Alumna of CSU, I’ve always been proud of and tuned in to our unique and culturally diverse college radio station.  There is always something interesting to hear on WCSB. It is a great opportunity for students and community to curate and create, and practice. It is a priceless cultural icon in Cleveland. This is a heartbreaking loss. Please consider saving WCSB and reinstating it in its former state. <br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\nSally J. Hudak<br />\r\n",

How can CSU and Dr. Bloomberg claim to support free speech and diversity of thought, while simultaneously destroying the most diverse radio station in Northeast Ohio? To destroy 50 years of history and culture in favor of playing ONE genre of music, 27/7 is clearly NOT a move made in the interest of diversity.  WCSB was a lifeline for local immigrant communities – where else could these families and their communities listen to music and talk programming in their native tongue? Where else could you listen to experimental world music, or obscure metal subgenres, or the history of Black music and art?  It is (or should be) plainly obvious to city council and the wider community what a grave loss this is.  I understand that not everyone loved everything that WCSB played – but WCSB offered SOMETHING for EVERYONE. To now only play one single genre of music will limit the reach and influence that the station once had, and it will now feel alien and inauthentic to most — and from a station that was once a bridge across communities, cultures, and people.  Ideastream has promised to offer internship opportunities to students, but no low-level internship could EVER provide the wealth of experience and responsibility that was already being provided to students through WCSB.  Dr. Bloomberg has increasingly made CSU hostile towards and inaccessible for local students, who are being priced out of what used to be a quality education and denied the opportunity and breadth of experience CSU used to offer.  This is yet another terrible and short-sighted decision that will not benefit ANYONE.  The outrage  from the community — made up of current students, university and station alumni, and listeners from Northeast Ohio and around the globe — is more than justified.  Listen to us.  I trust city council to see how egregious this decision is, how damaging this decision, and I know that you know in your heart that this move from CSU and Ideastream was WRONG.  I implore you to pass this resolution and stand on the side of free speech and diversity.",

As someone who was raised in Cleveland and continues my work and education in the city, I recognize WCSB as a pillar of not only Cleveland State University, but also of the community of Cleveland at large. Taking away the voices of a myriad of students and community members in such an underhanded and hostile manner was an egregious attempt to stifle creativity, passionate voices, and a cherished community. Moreover, this deal is simply impractical. There are no explicitly concrete provisions compelling Ideastream to provide the student opportunities so lauded by CSU as an integral part of the deal, instead being shrouded in vague language, with the agreement stating that &quot;Over the term of the PSOA, Ideastream will prioritize paid and for-credit internships, classroom-level projects and other opportunities for students…” A lack of specificity in language is a common tactic utilized to escape scrutiny and responsibility. For example, how many opportunities does Ideastream have to provide CSU students in order for it to quality as “prioritization”? The initial obfuscation of a number of provisions in the agreement, such as a seat on the Ideastream Board of Trustees for CSU President Laura Bloomberg, and a misleading emphasis on student opportunities, makes it clear that Cleveland State leadership knew this deal was not to the benefit of their students nor Cleveland as a whole. While providing career preparation is an important component of higher education, there is also an essential requirement for institutions to foster student connection and community, NOT squander it. A society where commodification is valued at the expense of art and community will inevitably breed a soulless, discontent, and unfulfilled polity. With these sentiments in mind, please support the effort to transfer WCSB back to the hands that kept the station flourishing for fifty years.",

CSU has taken away an enormous learning and growing experience from their students. It has also wiped out a bedrock institution to the Greater Cleveland creative and cultural community at large. WCSB was public service to area artists, musicians, creatives, and the general public looking to go deep into a particular genre of music, or to expand their horizons. It was also one of the very few places where musicians, bands, and composers in the area could have their work aired. Over the years, WCPN and Ideastream have only tossed crumbs to the arts and cultural community and never provided that same intense and continuous impact. This loss is a travesty.",

It's not about disliking jazz (WCSB played jazz!) and it's not about limiting the voice of Ideastream (accessible through other media channels in our market, including existing terrestrial radio!). It's about the needless destruction and erasure of all those OTHER voices, from the all of the foreign language audiences, to the on-air personalities, to that one nerdy weird middle school girl who gets exposed to that life-changing music at the end of the dial while she works late into the night on her homework.  GIVE IT BACK!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe action by Laura Bloomberg to hand over operations of the station to Ideastream has disenfranchised those voices -- and HOW it was done, in such a surreptitious way, speaks clearly of the actors' knowledge that what they were doing was WRONG. My voice is just one, but I am part of a unanimous response by our community who DOES NOT WANT to lose &quot;our&quot; WCSB. With the exception of Dr. Bloomberg and Kevin Martin, EVERY person I have spoken with on this issue thinks that it is a BAD IDEA, and a terrible loss. GIVE IT BACK.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis can all be resolved with a very simple solution: Return operation of the radio station WCSB at 89.3 to the students and volunteers who have run it for nearly 50 years.  JUST GIVE IT BACK.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn doing so, Dr. Bloomberg and Kevin Martin can redeem themselves as supporters of diversity and public discourse, which are the stated goals - and should be the ACTUAL missions - of their respective organizations, as well as the right side of history at this moment in time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n",

I have heard so much music and discussion from WCSB in my life, from my Great Aunt and Uncle playing Polka on Sunday mornings back in the late 70's/early 80's to my current 'listen to pretty much everything' WCSB is playing.<br />\r\nMore importantly than my personal gain is consideration for the independent live music venues, small business owners, non-profits, and especially the Student DJs... The alleyways and avenues WCSB has carved into the local music Community and also the non-profits benefitting, should be a major motivation to retore student programming. These types of messages will never be received by a younger audience again, unless the original format is restored. Thank you.",

Hostile takeovers of any campus entity accompanied by their  necessary partner in crime, the nondisclosure agreement (CSU & Ideastream had one in the wcsb hand-off) should be statutarily prohibited at public schools.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe improperly authorized hand-off of wcsb has impoverished culture in world rock n roll capitol Cleveland, OH. wcsb was one of the very few radio stations in town remaining true to Cleveland's rock n roll roots.  Rock n roll in all its forms from r&b to industrial is music of the people. wcsb presented it as such, giving the worthier non-capitalized, non-commercial bands  airings.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStudents, former students and selected  community members were passionate about their volunteer programming on wcsb.  And the radio station generated many on-campus jobs, as well as providing career-useful training. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe CSU president indicated in a recent interview that the new Ideastream/ CSU partnership gives her a seat on  Ideastram's board.  Well, Ideastream was already looking out for students; it was available for internships.  CSU can now further guide Ideastream, something with nebulous reward to a university as a whole that should be focused on higher education as a whole. The CSU president mentioned Ideastream in the wcsb hand-off promised  on-air spots promoting CSU. As Cleveland's only large public university, CSU does not have an exposure problem.  As a non-prof entity, it is allowed additional free public service exposure at many, many local media outlets. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe improper giveaway of Cleveland cultural stalwart wcsb is one of the biggest disgraces in Cleveland history.

We are a population of music lovers, and stations like WCSB helped spread knowledge of unpopular music through the city. The station helped expand our city’s musical horizons as well as fostered an environment for art to really thrive. Popular radio plays the same 4 songs over and over and over. WCSB highlighted strange and funky music that otherwise would never make the airwaves. They even had a proper jazz hour, where they would play abstract jazz as opposed to mainstream jazz standards like what the station now exclusively plays. We’ve really significantly hurt whatever semblance of culture we have left in this city by erasing WCSB and that decision needs to be reverted yesterday.",

            "comment": "Dear Council Members, <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am writing today as a concerned Ward 11 Edgewater constituent on behalf of the emergency resolution for vote on Monday, October 20, 2025, in support of WCSB being rightfully restored to the CSU students, that for over the last 49 years has cultivated, showcased, and contributed to the cultural vibrance of Cleveland. The former WCSB has existed as a beacon of diversity, culture, art, and community within Cleveland, bringing together people from diverse backgrounds and ages for decades, while creating life-changing student experiences and opportunities. And at low cost to CSU, as a large portion of its annual budget relies upon community contributions. As well, its staff typically consists of student DJs, who are largely unpaid except for a few paid intern positions, I believe, and its community members, who are unpaid volunteers, many of whom have contributed for years via weekly shows, events, and fundraising radiothons.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most recent surreptitious and disheartening corporate acquisition of WCSB's airwaves by Ideastream, with the full embrace of CSU's president Laura Bloomberg (who will now serve as a board member on Ideastream), is an attack on Cleveland's rich cultural community and very local and real public media service, a student-run community radio station which creates programming by and for Cleveland area community members. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike so many of us, I am sad, disgusted, and frankly outraged by the audacity and serious lack of transparency on the part of Ideastream and CSU's president Laura Bloomberg, as well as what they have further illustrated through their ongoing actions and words -- a complete lack of consideration, humility, and will to understand or cultivate a true community radio within the existing framework student-run WCSB.  On its face, this acquisition has serious corporate takeover vibes.  Ideastream, equally enabled by CSU president Laura Bloomberg, has appeared to have high-jacked a vital and beloved community entity, only to seemingly offer limited or no real student and community voices or input into its programming. They have instead shuttered the real local community voices and energy that WCSB students and community members have offered for generations. Ideastream’s actions (along with CSU’s leadership) have directly contradicted the professed mission statement of public media to be one of service and accountability to local communities and stakeholders, which was so recently expressed at the October 17, 2025, forum on the future of public media at the City Club of Cleveland, of which Ideastream President and CEO Kevin Martin was a speaker. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently, neither Ideastream, nor CSU leadership have considered the possible and probable impacts to CSU and the Cleveland community in their dismantlement of a true student and community member partnership public radio station. Nor have they appeared to show a genuine interest in forging any real working partnership with the previous existing structure or student and community member programming and programmers; instead both parties' actions and words have unfortunately illustrated to the public their collaborative effort in completely absconding a college's and local community's public media without consideration or recourse to the actual community it serves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am writing to you today because I love and cherish student-run WCSB. It is true community radio. I have had the opportunity to hear and be introduced to music that you would rarely hear elsewhere on the radio, if it weren't for college and community radio, and best of all, I have meet so many great people in our expansive Cleveland community and cultivated friendships because of WSCB. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI ask you to please consider voting for the proposed resolution to restore WCSB to the students. We need real community radio, not more &quot;community radio&quot; that is created and produced by corporate public media gatekeepers who reside in California or elsewhere. Let us show Ideastream and CSU leadership how to be accountable to a community and truly serve it.

The abruptness of the transition, without consultation or transparency, undermines trust and disregards the contributions of generations of students and volunteers who built the station into a beloved institution. The lack of guaranteed student opportunities and the silencing of grassroots voices is of much concern as it is a shift from inclusive education toward corporate branding, in my opinion.

Freedom of expression is a powerful education, one that WCSB’s listenership benefited from. We should not be replacing students’ creativity, grassroots collaborations, messiness, coolness, and love with jazz algorithms and internships in a field they were previously the innovators in. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI would be overjoyed by the reversal of this decision on the basis of community feedback and am hopeful to see a demonstration of the university listening to the city they serve.

As someone who values local, diverse, and community-driven media, I’m deeply disappointed by Cleveland State University’s decision to hand over WCSB to Ideastream with little warning or input from students and community volunteers. WCSB isn't just a radio station. It's one of the few remaining independent platforms in Cleveland where students could learn hands-on broadcasting, underrepresented voices could be heard, and experimental and multicultural programming could be enjoyed. Replacing decades of creative freedom with corporate jazz, no matter how polished, is a huge loss for Cleveland’s cultural landscape and for public access to authentic, grassroots radio.

If the City of Cleveland has supported Ideastream and CSU politically and financially, I ask Cleveland City Council to focus on the negative impact of a 49 year-old community and cultural institution being erased from Cleveland's airwaves.",

Any hour of the day there was something intersteing to hear, including many genres of music, movie scores, and even some world music. Additionally, WCSB was incredibily important  to our local music scene. It gave increased access and promotion for many of our local bands and musicians, while also hosting some great events that really brought the community together. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe switch to a pre-programmed 24/7 jazz station is such a shame. Even though they may have some &quot;paid internship&quot; opportunities for CSU sturdents, the real world and diversese experience WCSB brought can never be reaplaced. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI don't know what caused this transfer to happen, but I feel like there was some behind the scenes dealings that we are owed and explanation for. The president of ideastream and CSU both are non-Clevlanders, and I feel like this new &quot;partnership&quot; is just a big checkmark for both their resumes when they no doubt lease Cleveland in the near future for &quot;bigger opporrtunites,&quot; leaving the our city and our music scene worse off.",

They just shook my hand and treated me like family. Losing WCSB is truly like losing an old friend. Everything about this &quot;deal&quot; between Idea stream and csu sounds and feels sketchy. It feels dirty. It feels wrong. And maybe that's because it is sketchy. It is dirty. It is wrong. I know it. The community knows it. And deep down idea stream and csu knows it too. I don't know what power local government has in reversing this decision, but I'm hoping that something can be done. College radio, especially wcsb, plays a vital role all across the country.

Ideastream was given reign over one of the last vestiges of creativity, diversity, cultural enrichment that CSU offered and has painted it landlord gray.  We don't need more monochrome radio.  This smacks of an initiative to squash voices of dissent that may be speaking on particular current issues and appease wealthy donors. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis was one of three radio stations I actually liked.  I can't stand commercial radio and after working in sheet metal, developed a loathing for the same 50 classic rock songs played ad nauseum.  I told friends and coworkers about 89.3.  I can't even stand NPR stations anymore since entities allegedly dedicated to cultural enrichment keep becoming tools for political propaganda and homogeneity.  I listened to hundreds of hours of 89.3 while driving routes for work.  I recorded bits of music to look up later if i didn't catch the name of the artist.  I loved the Halloween themed programs.  I could hear new but obscure music and vintage obscure music.  These stations make listeners aware of local artists and promote under represented local cultural events.  The students who ran the station gained far more practical experience than they would through internships and a very different skill set for solving problems live instead of making pre-recorded content. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSmooth jazz is a dilution of everything that influenced jazz in the first place.  It's the musical equivalent of office wallpaper.  CSU has been trying to sanitize its image for a while, ridding the place of any programs geared toward women and cultural diversity, and this is yet another step in that direction.

To be perfectly frank, if you are “preparing students for the career of the future” radio ain't it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a corporate takeover where the “win win” goes to the board and executive members involved. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCSU, like Idea stream, would like to remind everyone they are public institutions.

CSU’s President Laura Bloomberg and Ideastream’s CEO Kevin Martin keep trying to paint and brush this off as a “win-win” for both students and themselves (or more so - their affiliations), but this is really just a “win-win” for themselves, and a 50 year legacy built by volunteers bulldozed over by self-interests (hiding under the umbrella of “public interest”).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLaura Bloomberg, her administration/board, and Ideastream (Kevin Martin largely) pulled the rug under every programmer on WCSB. She thought it was a kind idea to send an email to all of the university before the zoom meeting in which she stated “WCSB programming is now the purview of Ideastream”. No plan or time for programmers to make a [still, would be a reluctant] good-bye. Key-cards de-activated and police escorting students out of the station right afterwards. She says that students can figure out ways on their own to reach the public (podcasts, live streaming), but 89.3 FM is how we reached those people (with the internet stream as back-up for those not in Cleveland). There was no immediate (and still no) plan by her administration to remedy or help with this. As she said in her appearance on The Sound of Ideas forum this past Tuesday, “I'm not a media person”. The only thing that this does for students, is a few (unannounced!) internships, and a seat on the board of trustees for herself (and ad spots for CSU). By the way, she's only been with CSU/Cleveland itself since 2021. In the same forum, she said that losing WCSB was a “tremendous loss”.... Dr. Bloomberg… weren't you the one that signed off on this “strategic” plan? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nKevin Martin, on the other hand, keeps bringing up “the study&quot; that said “people want jazz on terrestrial radio”... did that study say “Would you support (without notice) taking over a student-community radio station of 50 years and replacing it with 24/7 Jazz?”. He also keeps bringing up that “it's not smooth jazz”... which many in the community have stated is what is played. That is false, it's “Nothing but Jazz 24/7”. Jazz is fine and cool, but Ideastream took a 24/7 variety of different voices and made it entirely a jazz-focused station. WCSB had EIGHT different Jazz programs before the takeover. Hmmm…. would WVIZ PBS watchers enjoy it if the channel just became a 24/7 run of Antiques Roadshow? I don't think so. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoth Bloomberg and Martin have also stated recently how the station was just a student club…. not true. WCSB had hosts that were students, alumni, and community members. Martin even said this past Friday at the City Club of Cleveland, that it was like a “chess” or “drama” club.... We had listeners from different ages. JazzNEO seems tailored mainly towards just an older audience, and when talking about his “study”, Martin brings up how an older audience wanted to hear Jazz on the radio. Did he forget the part that we were a college (and community) station for nearly 50 years?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHopefully the 50 years of WCSB can be honored and the student/community voices will be heard on FM again. As many have supported this cause, WCSB was a legacy of people who wanted their voices and a variety of music genres to be heard, from multiple different ages and backgrounds (not just a “student club”).  I love public media, but Ideastream (CSU also --- this is a partnership overall!) has messed up big time.",

In just doing my small show for 3 years, I had listeners tune in regularly from big cities America and across the globe. This ranged from niche music genres, such as  Psych Rock, Ambient Electronic, or Doom Metal, all the way to ethnic music genres that have almost no airspace such as Arabic music, Slovenian music, Hungarian Music, and Polish Music, among others. People recognized this station for its highly regarded quality AND quantity of culture that we distributed, through the commitment of a large population a volunteer DJ's who did what they loved most for - Finding good music that you couldn't find easily anywhere else. And they did this for free, mind you, for the benefit and for the recognition of our city. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDisregarding the abominable behavior and dismisable demeanor both Ideastream and CSU dealt with this issue and with the volunteers and patrons of WCSB, I think another issue is that I just don't see what the need is for a single non-commercial broadcaster, such as Ideastream, to own not one, but three different fm signals within the same area. That's just monopolizing a scarce resource that, as a noncommercial frequency, is primarily for the public good and not for profit. I don't see them doing this takeover for the benefit of the majority of Cleveland citizens - In fact, I see it as just benefiting a small minority of citizens who do not care about sustaining the history and culture of Cleveland, but wish to sterilize it into what they want to see, with large donations and no considerations. Ultimately, I think if this trend continues, people will just abandon radio instead, as it turns into a homogenous curation of things they're not interested in and a sterile and alien culture and community they're not committed to uplifting and supporting. I'd argue this issue is, in a way, a microcosm of the identity crisis Cleveland, as a whole, has been having for the last 10 years. And as a proud Clevelander, I would hate for people to abandon Cleveland.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm not really sure what could be done to change this action, if the council would agree to take this cause up, but any action is a step in the right direction. I know how poorly the &quot;Modell Law&quot; worked when push came to shove with the Cleveland Browns, but maybe something along those lines would work when it comes to limiting non-commercial broadcast affiliations within the county area, in order to promote a vibrant community and dissway monopolizing actors. I dunno though, thats just a thought - I'm artist, not a lawyer. If I was one, I'd probably down in city council, arguing with a ton more vigor and wit than what the written word has to offer me this late at night. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut if I can say just one more thing, on a personal note - Besides what WCSB means to the community and what it means for our culture of Cleveland.... I've lived in many through many different situations and environments, from Westlake, to Florida, to New York City. Worked with people along all walks of life, from carpet installers just trying to make their mortgage, to actors who were just waiting to quit their barista job after landing a gig that gets them famous. I even lived in hospital for about a year after falling off a roof and met a potpourri of individuals, both patients and as providers who varied as wildly as can be. All these things I've seen, and lived through, and I'd still say that WCSB was the only place I've been a part of that I felt like I truly belonged when I was there. It was like a home, to me, and to countless other former DJ's and listeners. Like our own little island of misfit toys, where we could be ourselves and not worry about being different. It was something we loved for its unique and quintessential timber of its own being. Something that we cared for and nurtured, supported and believed in. An identity we celebrated when times were good and place we could commiserate when times were not so good. We love this place - I loved this place. It was our home, our eclectic, sporadic, utterly oblique, unique, beautiful home. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease, help us, our listeners and supporters, and the larger community who doesn't even know what they lost. Please help us get back our home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you,<br />\r\nDJ No Refund",

            "comment": "The shameful and secretive way in which the original WCSB was stolen from the city of Cleveland cannot be left without comment from those impacted. For me, as a young person in the 80s and 90s, WCSB was a place where I could hear music that no one else would play. It showed me the possibilities of a true alternative voice on radio and I learned to love things that are not in the mainstream. From there it also supported messaging from people who are actively oppressed in many communities. Again providing an alternative that could get information to people who needed it as opposed to the purified/sanctioned messaging on other stations. Replacing that student and volunteer led voice is a major loss for Cleveland. While I don't think we know the full story of what happened, the way it was done with no interaction with the station members suggests that those with the power to do this knew they were actively doing something wrong. Had they been honest and upfront, they would have given the people who did the programming time to say goodbye to their listeners or give them a pre-arranged alternative to continue listening. Instead, they ejected the broadcasters with no warning and cut the programming over to the new format. Not only was this unprofessional, but it was also clear evidence that there is more behind this than what we have been told. There was some message or some person who the decision makers wanted to silence for some reason. Given the number of messages that are being suppressed today due to authoritarian bent in many leaders around the world, it is anyone's guess what that message might have been or who that person was. While they have been silenced for now, the college radio community won't just sit down and smile. The dishonesty won't be forgotten and the trust (CSU admin and NPR) is broken.",

Many cities never come close to the quality of programming available on the now defunct WCSB, and WRUW, and WJCU. Losing WCSB 89.3 FM, as it approached fifty years on air, would have been heartbreaking under any circumstances, but the approach that Ideastream and Cleveland State University took feels like the worst kind of betrayal, not only to the students and community members who volunteered to keep the station going, but to listeners spanning the globe, who turned to WCSB to discover new music, old music, weird music, music from aroind the world, or to hear about news and events happening in Cleveland and beyond. I sincerely hope, that with guidance and pressure from the Cleveland City Council, that Ideastream will agree to reverse course and restore the priceless programming, that it abruptly and unceremoniously cancelled, back to the airwaves. As a lifelong Clevelander, I can say with certainty that college radio shaped who I am as a person, and I want those opportunities to hear new sounds, new rhythms, amd new ideas to be there for generations to come.  <br />\r",

The station’s programming, specifically the programming being on the airwaves, serviced the people of the greater Cleveland area and was a community initiative that I can attest made many differing individuals feel represented. For many, the 1-2 hour shows that aired on the station was a way to connect to others within Cleveland both by way of hearing direct community opinions and happenings from DJs in addition to the various diverse programs on the station. The sheer rang and diversity of the programming being a direct reflection for so many groups within the fabric of our city, many of whom lacking appropriate representation in other avenues and ventures throughout the mainstream culture of Cleveland. WCSB as a student and alum organization, has amplified and held all of these diverse pieces of culture on a level playing field for all to hear, learn, and connect with. Something that a contested and dubious 24 hour Jazz station seems to stifle.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nThe takeover and takedown of the station by CSU, and more specifically President Bloomberg, via a covert deal with Ideastream has altered the way in which I feel connected to the people within this city. More than anything I wish to argue that the station’s broadcasting acted as a public service to the people of Cleveland. A service that has been ended without any consultation or proper amendment within the station or by anyone within the community. Please do not let community voices and initiatives end by way of greater corporate enterprise and sheer willpower.

I donate about $200 per year to the station just for these programs. Most of my recent musical culture came from these three people and their shows. It is material I can't find anywhere else. As a professional musician, I depended on these shows to expand my musical vocabulary, and also to find where musicians were playing in Cleveland who played this progressive style of music. Once this was taken from me, I was surprised how much I derived from WCSB, and how much I miss the music and the personalities. It was a real gut punch and loss of a community of like-minded folks.

You cannot put a price on what we all individually did over the years to make the station what it was and what our community still is. What an insanely counter productive move by 2 out of touch organizations meant to “enrich us”. I was a DJ on the air Thursdays 9-11am from 2010 - 2020 on my radio show Pleasure Leftists. The entirety of my 20s. I started when I was 20 years old as a communications student. I was interviewed to join the station by students, the executive staff. The education of real time experience and the discipline of showing up each week to create my show is more valuable than anything I ever learned in a classroom. My fellow DJs would probably agree. I met bandmates, co workers life long friends and built and shared in the world I know now in Cleveland. I wish anyone with the power to do so to hold some of these people accountable for the damage these decisions do to this legacy, our current community and future generations who might not get to have the same experience.

In our current day and age, independent media is becoming increasingly important, offering a place for people without financial clout and leverage to exchange ideas, open new worlds, and simply play really, really great music. WCSB represented a wide swath of our community, offering a glimpse into worlds where one may never have had the exposure. This type of discovery is what made WCSB so important. The ability to share, search for, and find new things, is enriching and rewarding to everyone involved. Sharing of knowledge is power.

It is a travesty and disservice to the Cleveland community not to mention those folks who donated to WCSB during their yearly radiothon when they ask for donations for station upkeep. That money is being kept by CSU and that in itself is a crime because the money will not be used as per the original intention of the donors to support WCSB. <br />\r\nIf the city can help reverse this decision, that would be incredible.",

CSU and Ideastream's joint choice to silence a community treasure and site of student vision, voice, and agency—shameful and misguided. CSU is a public university and Ideastream is public media. Institutions like these should safeguard the shared art and culture of this city, not extract resources from college students and the community whenever it benefits them.

Over years of daily listening, the station has introduced me to incredible music, across many genres, that I would never hear otherwise. The station is also a distinct point of local pride. When people from other places ask what Cleveland is like, I tell them about 89.3 first, even before LJ Shanghai. As is clear in the station’s wake, listening also makes me happier, less stressed out, more tuned in. WSCB makes my life better. As our protests demonstrate, this is true for many other Clevelanders, too. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nIt is difficult to understand why this radio station, which does so much good, should be cut. As a local educator who supervises student workers, I find CSU and Ideastream's claim that this takeover is in the interest of students' professional development to be unserious, irresponsible, and without imagination. Internships should increase student agency, responsibility, and professional readiness. The shutdown of WSCB demonstrates the superficiality of current CSU and Ideastream leadership's commitment to &quot;true professional growth opportunities&quot; for students. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nWSCB has been an important source of good in Cleveland for fifty years.

As a content creator and professional communicator, college radio gave me the confidence to find my voice and audience. Additionally, college radio provides a platform for unbridled creativity and diversity in programming. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut since Ideastream took over the frequency, we are all left without these voices. A true sense of community and tradition up-rooted for the sake of a single genre of music.

Eclectic. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince I was in high school, tuning into WCSB at any given time of day allowed me to discover new genres of music and voices from the community that wouldn't have otherwise.

WCSB had served an extremely diverse community for nearly 50 years. The contributions the station made to the Northeast Ohio music scene are enormous and have gone far beyond anything the new format will be able to touch. WCSB was a lifeline to the ethnic music communities, punk & rock underground music scenes, reggae, folk, hip-hop and metal scenes, among many others...including jazz. (There were already several jazz programs being broadcast on WCSB before the format change). This is a total slap in the face to the thousands of dedicated listeners in N.E. Ohio, not to mention the staff (past and present) who gave countless hours of their time (for free!) to make WCSB what it was. Shame on Ideastream Media and CSU for orchestrating this hostile take over - done with zero advance notice, and with the campus police escorting the staff out of the building like they were criminals. Bring back the programmers and previous student-run format. WCSB, before the October 3rd, 2025 takeover, was an important asset to this region.

It staggers me to think that the other possibility is that they did know, but didn't care. Please help to right this wrong.",

The student run station was given no notice, and were escorted out by police within a few minutes of the decision being made. WCSB was an extremely important community resource for many underserved groups in the listening area, and they are now silenced in favor of streamed music from an out of town organization. As a regular listener since 1983, and also someone who donated to the station on a fairly regular basis via their annual Radio-thons, I find it tragic that an extremely diverse and important community voice was silenced through unclear and somewhat shady circumstances, to be replaced with a bland, monochrome and unnecessary source of streamed music from a non local source. This is a horrible decision by those involved with Cleveland State University and Ideastream, and if there is any way to look into getting the station back to it's student programmers, it would be nothing but a just and worthwhile thing to do, and would allow the station to serve the local community and listening audience with the important information and diverse music it once had, in favor of the bland and monotonous background music that it was switched over to. Thank you for any consideration on this matter. With kindest regards.",

The student-led broadcasting of WCSB served not just those attending CSU, but the broader community. As a nonprofit broadcaster WCSB was able to offer a heterogeneous programming mix that served multiple audience segments in our community across both the airwaves and internet. For some segments, WCSB was their sole representation on the broadcast dial. So it is especially troubling that administrations of two nonprofit entities, CSU and IdeaStream, colluded to silence WCSB in seeming violation of the very missions of those entities, i.e., to serve the public good and earn the public trust through a dedication to truth. It is important that City Council call out what their actions truly are: a self-serving backroom deal that comes at the expense of the broader community in which they operate.",

            "comment": "Before Ideastream took it over, WCSB 89.3 FM had been one of the shining beacons of free speech and alternative music in Cleveland and the surrounding areas for nearly half a century. Cleveland is known as the Rock 'n' Roll capital, and WCSB played a significant role in earning that title.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany nationally known musical artists—such as R.E.M., Metallica, Nine Inch Nails, and Devo—got their early breaks on college radio. WCSB was often a go-to destination for these emerging artists to promote their music, especially when mainstream commercial radio wasn’t interested. Acts of all kinds knew WCSB as the place to be if you wanted to break into the music industry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany former WCSB DJs went on to have successful careers at WMMS, a station that was instrumental in bringing the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame to Cleveland. Names like Kid Leo, Jeff “Flash” Ferenc, and Jeff Kinzbach—who all got their start at WCSB—are part of that legacy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWCSB was a cornerstone of Cleveland's cultural, artistic, and musical scene. And now, all that history and community involvement has been discarded—thrown into the wastebin—so a few wealthy donors can listen to jazz all day. One has to ask: what serves the public better—offering a wide diversity of art and ideas, or playing just one genre of music around the clock?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWCSB was more than just CSU's station—it was Cleveland’s station. Students didn’t just contribute; they ran the day-to-day operations. In addition, countless volunteers from the community gave their time to provide their expertise in a wide array of musical genres, such as blues, soul, metal, punk, funk, reggae, and folk. And other community volunteers provided programming that reached Cleveland’s many ethnic communities, including Latino, Arabic, Hungarian, Polish, German, Chinese, and Slovenian listeners. These communities looked to WCSB not only for music and entertainment in their own languages, but for vital information about their countries of origin. How many stations can say that? Not many—and certainly not in Cleveland.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for CSU and Ideastream touting “internship opportunities” for students, they’ve failed miserably to recognize the stark difference between working in a controlled, limited internship and participating in an open, creative environment that fosters real self-expression. Their claim that students can simply “go online” to continue their programming is a hollow substitute. There’s a vast difference between running a real radio station and uploading content to a website.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet’s also not forget that not everyone can afford a smartphone or computer to stream content. Many rely on terrestrial radio—and CSU and Ideastream have now taken that away from them, likely for good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBroadcast radio operates under federal regulations. Students at WCSB learned firsthand about FCC compliance, indecency laws, Emergency Alert System protocols, and station identification requirements. Streaming platforms are not bound by these rules. Every licensed radio station in the U.S. requires staff who understand regulatory compliance—something you cannot learn from podcasting alone. Will students learn this through Ideastream internships? No one knows. There’s been zero planning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn live radio, there is no “pause” button. Students learned to solve technical issues in real time, operate sound boards during live shows, take calls, and respond to breaking news. These real-world broadcasting skills cannot be developed through pre-recorded podcasts. And Ideastream has no intention of offering students any over-the-air experience like WCSB did.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt WCSB, students also learned radio frequency engineering, antenna systems, and transmitter maintenance. They handled real transmission problems affecting thousands of listeners. This type of hands-on technical knowledge is specific to over-the-air broadcasting. Streaming requires only basic digital audio skills by comparison. Broadcast engineers are essential to every radio and TV station—and this kind of expertise is not gained from streaming.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFCC-licensed stations are required to serve the public interest. WCSB gave students a platform to learn community engagement and how to handle emergency broadcasting during severe weather or local crises. Streaming platforms have no public service obligation. Broadcasting exists to serve the public; streaming exists to entertain consumers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA student who operated an FCC-licensed station like WCSB has tangible broadcast experience—far more meaningful than a one-semester internship or a podcast that competes with millions of others recorded in bedrooms. Broadcast hiring managers know the difference. And as of now, no one at CSU or Ideastream has outlined what students will actually be learning in these supposed internships. The pitch sounds good—until you look at the details. Then it falls apart. And right now, there are no details at all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, I want to publicly condemn Cleveland State University for its shameful treatment of its own students. Taking a recognized and active student organization, changing its mission without any student or faculty input, doing it under the cover of an NDA, and then informing students just 15 minutes before the change—while summoning the police to remove them—is the height of hypocrisy from a university that claims to promote “student belonging and success.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNothing says “you belong” quite like dismantling something without cause or warning, and then calling the authorities on your own students as if they were criminals. Cleveland State University should be deeply ashamed of its actions.",

The mishandling of this not only damages the Universities reputation but gives the average listeners less in a time when we need more.<br />\r\nMy thoughts center around two things that I am certain were not in consideration upon making this decision.  The charitable donations each year to THE STATION .  Money donated for continuation of the station and programs that people listening all over the world added to over the years.  What must they be thinking right now?<br />\r\nSecondly, so many listeners no longer with us have donated music collections to the station, now sitting empty and unused.  Is that forever now, as I'm sure JAZZ NEO has no use for them?  What would it take to organize the programming separately so we can take a step forward rather than ten steps backwards as this has become a multi-faceted argument about much more than Cleveland and music.",

I have talked with no one yet who wants to listen to it voluntarily on high-quality FM.  The allocated broadcast radio spectrum is a priceless and irreplaceable part of our lives; internet &quot;radio&quot; channels do not substitute for it because their listenership can be monitored cheaply and easily. Live radio listeners cannot be monitored without effort and expense that are considerable even to a wealthy government seeking to know who is consuming the content of the free press.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis year, The Voice of America was silenced.  Three other college radio stations were shut down this year (KTRU, KSVR, WSC), plus university student newspapers have, incredibly, been ordered &quot;not to report news.&quot; I would have thought that Cleveland's public university was above that.  It still has the chance to be.  Please return student control to WCSB.",

This once in a lifetime opportunity was the hobby and livelihood of many people that were here long before me. I was only here for only a couple of weeks and already felt like I was about to be apart of a group that I'd be able to call family. Laura Bloomberg sold us out for a resume detail and a bunch of ad shout-outs over the radio for Cleveland State. We are more than that. They were worth more than that. Laura claims she opened opportunity by stripping away programming from every corner of the music space and replacing it with jazz. Smooth jazz to be precise; a genre so disconnected and despised by the rest of the jazz world for being completely uninspired and going against the original purpose of jazz. She took away an entire community on National College Radio Day. And she took it away right before the 50th anniversary of WCSB. Nobody knew of this; this was all done behind our backs. Nobody at the station was ever told about this and this was in the works for months, maybe even longer. This was devastating to me as I wanted to pursue music in some form in my lifetime. I was given this amazing path in life. It is gone now. But, there is still hope. Please help us bring back 50 years of history and give the station back. Thank you for your time and please give Cleveland back our station.",

Cleveland State’s radio station helped launch the careers of many of the legendary WMMS disc jockeys who defined an era of Cleveland rock radio. The station’s success — and its impact on our city’s culture — came directly from those CSU roots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo why take that legacy away from today’s students and the generations to come? CSU’s radio program is more than a class or a club — it’s a creative outlet, a training ground, and a vital part of Cleveland’s cultural story. Cutting programs like this at our downtown university doesn’t strengthen the institution — it weakens it. Fewer opportunities mean fewer students, less community connection, and a diminished reputation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCleveland State should be investing in what makes it distinctive — not dismantling it.<br />\r\n",
